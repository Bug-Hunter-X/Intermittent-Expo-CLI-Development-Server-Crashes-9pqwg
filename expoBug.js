While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without any clear error messages in the terminal.  This occurred intermittently, making debugging difficult. The app itself would function correctly when built, only the dev server was impacted. I've tried reinstalling Expo CLI, clearing caches, and checking for conflicting packages, but the problem persists.
